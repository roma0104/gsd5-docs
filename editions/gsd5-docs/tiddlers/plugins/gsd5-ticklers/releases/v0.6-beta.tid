! Added Features

* Ticklers are back!

!! Limitations

GSD5 Ticklers is very bare-bones at the moment.

* The GSD5 Ticklers plugin only supports the English/Gregorian calendar at this time.
* The week starts on Sunday. [[#3|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5-ticklers/issues/3]]
* No repeating occurrences. [[#2|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5-ticklers/issues/2]]
* No snoozing. [[#4|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5-ticklers/issues/4]]
* "One time firing" of alerts.
* Day granularity only [[#5|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5-ticklers/issues/5]]
* Manual date entry requires <kbd>Enter</kbd> keystroke.

! Notes

Be sure to upgrade to GSD5 v0.6-beta before using plugin.  While it is possible that lesser GSD5 versions will be compatible with Ticklers, I have not tested it.
