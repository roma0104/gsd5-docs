creator: Roma

released: 201502100315

! Added Features

* Collapsible ~BlueBox.  The ~BlueBox found on GSD5 tiddlers can be minimized to reduce screen space when needed.  A Tiddler View Toolbar button is provided to toggle states.  [[Github Issue|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5/issues/40]]
* Collapsible Lists.  Lists created with the [[gsd5-list|GSD5 List Macro]] macro can be hidden by clicking the title of the list.  [[Github Issue|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5/issues/22]]
* GSD5 List Macro rewrite.  A new macro is provided to build lists.  Combines several smaller macros into a single macro.  This should make it easier for non-programmers to create customized lists.  There is no formal documentation for the macro at this time.  [[Github Issue|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5/issues/39]]
* Show/hide new GSD5 tiddlers.  GSD5 tiddlers can be shown or hidden based upon user preferences.  [[Github Issue|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5/issues/37]]
* Action Contexts.  Actions can be given contexts, allows users to further categorise Actions into related groups even though they may not be of the same Project.  [[Github Issue|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5/issues/15]]
* No-Next-Action List.  List of Projects that do not have a Next Action associated with it.  [[Github Issue|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5/issues/13]]
* CSS classes on Buttons/Widgets.  Buttons and Widgets previously without CSS classes now have GSD5 CSS classes.  [[Github Issue|https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5/issues/32]]

! Notes
There is non-critical breakage of user configuration.  The solution is to reassert user preferences.
