Assigning [[Wating Actios|$:/plugins/gsd5/help/HelpPanel/Actions]] to Contacts is a particularly useful way to delegate Actions to team members and track who was given what.  

Additionally, Contacts can be associated with all Actions and Projects.  This is useful if you have a person that is the main point of contact on a Project or Action.
