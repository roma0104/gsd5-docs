GSD5, or Getting-Stuff-Done 5, is a plugin for [[TiddlyWiki5|http://tiddlywiki.com]] that attempts to combine the workflow and philosophy of David Allen's __[[Getting Things Done|http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/]]__ with the ~TiddlyWiki5 platform.  GSD5 is heavily influenced by [[mGSD|http://mgsd.tiddlyspot.com/]] for ~TiddlyWiki classic.

This is a short primer on how to start using GSD5, for a more indepth look at GTD/GSD, spending a small amount of money on a short read is worth it.
