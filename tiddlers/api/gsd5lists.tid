title: GSD5Lists
tags: API

The tag `$:/tags/GSD5Lists` allows authors to add a new list view to be included in the possible selection of lists displayed in the Dashboard.  Applying this tag to a list will not immediately display the list but include the list in the GSD5/core control panel.  Once checked, the list will display on the Dashboard.

Lists are displayed in the order they appear in core control panel.  To change the ordering, overwriting of the tiddler [[$:/tags/GSD5Lists]] will be necessary.

Providing the field `caption` provides a user-friendly caption the shortly summarizes the purpose of the list.  This is displayed in the GSD5/core control panel.
